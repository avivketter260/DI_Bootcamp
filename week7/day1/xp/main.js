// Create a new folder called - npm-node
// Create a JS file called - main.js
// Add the following code to the file main.js :

// let a = 5;
// let b = 10;
//  console.log('hello you are ' + (a+b))

// Write some more code in the main.js file so when you run it in the command prompt it logs Hello you are 15


// Write the following code, in a main.js file:

let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let x;
let c = 6;
x = a + b;

// Add some more code in the main.js so when you run it using nodemon, it logs the sum of a + b as a first run.
// Tip: you need to change the package.json file in order to achieve this.

// Update the main.js file to console.log the sum of x + c
console.log(x+c)
