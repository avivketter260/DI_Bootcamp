        <h1>About domestic cats </h1>

            them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for <strong>
                companionship.

            Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense
            forests.<br>
            It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and
            at<br>
            twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and<br>
            composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate
            when<br>
            hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.
