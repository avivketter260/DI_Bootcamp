                Tony Stark. Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. <br>Son of legendary inventor and weapons
                contractor Howard Stark. When Tony Stark is assigned to <br>give a weapons presentation to an Iraqi unit led
                by Lt. Col. James Rhodes, he's given a ride on enemy lines.<br>That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee
                that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - <br>barely - with a chest full of
                shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart.<br> In order to survive he comes up with a way to
                miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. <br> Thus Iron Man is
                born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. <br>Once back home, he then begins work
                on perfecting the Iron Man suit.<br> But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his
                own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.
